//! LID-PN (Linked ID to Phone Number) Types
//!
//! This module provides types for mapping between WhatsApp's Linked IDs (LIDs)
//! and phone numbers. The cache is used for Signal address resolution - WhatsApp Web
//! uses LID-based addresses for Signal sessions when available.
//!
//! The cache maintains bidirectional mappings:
//! - LID -> Entry (for getting phone number from LID)
//! - Phone Number -> Entry (for getting LID from phone number)
//!
//! When multiple LIDs exist for the same phone number (rare), the most recent one
//! (by `created_at` timestamp) is considered "current".

/// The source from which a LID-PN mapping was learned.
/// Different sources have different trust levels and handling for identity changes.
